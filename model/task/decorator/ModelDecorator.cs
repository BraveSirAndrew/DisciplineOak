/**
 * This class represents a decorator of a task. A decorator is a task with only
 * one child, whose behavior it modifies. A decorator is used in situations in
 * which we want to execute a particular task but in a little different way.
 * <p>
 * Typical examples of decorators are:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>Filters: they decide whether the child task can continue running or not.
 * Some examples of filters are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Limit filter: which limits the number of times a task can execute.
 * <li>Until fail filter: which repeats a task until it fails.
 * </ul>
 * <li>Inverter: inverts the status code of a task.
 * <li>Semaphore guard: they are associated to resources. If the resource is
 * currently being used by another task, the new task cannot start running, so
 * it fails.
 * </ul>
