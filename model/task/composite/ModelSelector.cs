/**
 * This class represents a task with one or more children, which are run
 * sequentially.
 * <p>
 * A selector tries to run all its children sequentially. Therefore, there is an
 * active child task. However, when the current active task fails, the selector
 * does not fail, but goes on to the next child task, which is evaluated. A
 * selector succeeds if one of the tasks succeeds, and fails if all the child
 * tasks fail.
