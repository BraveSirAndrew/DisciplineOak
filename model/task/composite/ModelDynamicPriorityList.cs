/**
 * This class represents a task with one or more children, only one being
 * evaluated.
 * <p>
 * A ModelDynamicPriorityList has a current active child, which is the task that
 * is being evaluated. The very first time the ModelDynamicPriorityList is
 * spawned, the active child is set to the left most task whose guard is
 * evaluated to true. However, the current active task may change when the task
 * is ticked, according to the guards of the other tasks: if there is a task to
 * the left of the current active task whose guard is true, the latter is
 * terminated, and the new current active task is set to the former. In case
 * there are several tasks to the left of the current active task whose guards
 * are evaluated to true, the current active task will be the left most one.
