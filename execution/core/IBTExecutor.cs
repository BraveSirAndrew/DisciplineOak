/**
 * A behaviour tree executor (entity that is able to run a behaviour tree) must

 * <p>
 * This is the part of the behaviour trees execution interface that is exposed
 * to clients. The execution process of behaviour trees is driven by ticks,
 * which means that they only perform calculations when they are ticked. At
 * every tick, they are given a little amount of time to think and evolve as
 * expected. If a behaviour tree is not ticked, then it does not go on.
 * <p>
 * An IBTExecutor defines two main methods, one for ticking the behaviour tree
 * it is running, and another one for terminating the tree.
 * <p>
 * Behaviour trees are represented by the ModelTask class.

	 * CPU time and they not evolve.
	 * <p>
	 * By calling this method, the underlying BT will be ticked, so it will
	 * think and evolve accordingly.
